## Features
**Loading Data: Import and read CSV data files into the project for analysis.

**Data Cleaning and Processing: Clean and preprocess the data by merging datasets with pandas. Perform operations to compute new values based on the integrated dataset.

**Data Visualization: Create three visualizations using matplotlib, seaborn, or another plotting library to present and analyze the data effectively.

## Data Dictionary

Please refer to the [Data Dictionary](DATA DICTIONARY.md) for detailed information about the dataset fields.

## Features
**1. Activity Tracking**

Analyze daily activity metrics such as steps taken, and calories burned. This feature helps users monitor their physical activity levels over time.

**2. Sleep Analysis**

Evaluate sleep patterns and quality, including total sleep duration, sleep stages, and sleep efficiency. This provides insights into how well users are sleeping and areas for improvement.

**3. Goal Setting and Progress Tracking**

Set fitness goals and track progress towards achieving them. This feature allows users to establish personal targets for steps, distance, calories, and more, and monitor their progress over time.
