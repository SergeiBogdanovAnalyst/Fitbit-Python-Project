## Features
* Loading Data: Import and read CSV data files into the project for analysis.

* Data Cleaning and Processing: Clean and preprocess the data by merging datasets with pandas. Perform operations to compute new values based on the integrated dataset.
 
* Data Visualization: Create three visualizations using matplotlib, seaborn, or another plotting library to present and analyze the data effectively.

## Data Dictionary

Please refer to the [Data Dictionary](Data_Dictionary.md) for detailed information about the dataset fields.

## Insights

**1. Activity Tracking Insights**

The peak of physical activity occurs between 5 pm and 7 pm, possibly suggesting that people engage in exercise or outdoor activities after their workday.
