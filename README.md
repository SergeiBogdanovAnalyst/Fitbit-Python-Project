# Fitbit Python Project

## Overview
Welcome to the Fitbit Python Project! This project is designed to analyze Fitbit data and provide valuable insights into activity and health habits. Our goal is to offer a comprehensive tool that helps users understand their fitness patterns, track progress, and make informed decisions about their health. 
This README file will guide you through the setup process, highlight key features, and provide instructions on how to use the project effectively.
